        <h2> About Her's </h2>
        <p> The story of the band "Her's" is tragic. Before I was aware of the fate that befell the group,
            I often wondered why the group had not produced new music in a while. After all, their
            dreamy voices and melodious beats serve as a perfect backdrop for any setting.<p>

    <section class="ab2">
            It wasn't long before I finally decided to hunt for information. The members
            of the two-person band were <a href= "https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/29/uk/hers-uk-band-killed-us-crash-intl-scli-gbr/index.html">
            killed while on tour </a> in the U.S., therefore halting any new album creation - forever. <br><br>
            The pair met in Liverpool while attending University. <b> Stephen Fitzpatrick and Audun Laading </b> employed a symphony of sound 
            that I have instituted as the perfect nighttime playlist at the brewery I work at.
